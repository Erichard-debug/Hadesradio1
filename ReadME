The purpose of this file as shown by the examples in the folder SDRTextFiles is to produce a plot comparing the Reletive Intensity (dB) to the recorded frequncy measured by your SDR file. In order to do this adjust the title and the reletive path of the file as well as the Y-Min and Y-Max of the expected intensity as shown in the example below in SDR-plot.py

<!-- fig, ax = plt.subplots()
spectrumGrid(ax, 'Mounted Parabolic Build', r'SDRTextFiles\para2.txt', 0, 0.0001)
plt.show() -->
